# Building Infrastructure

Current Working Directory now is `terraform/dev`

### 1. Initial Terraform Resource

```bash
# Start Project and Install Dependencies
terraform init
```

### 2. Infrastructure Planning

```bash
# After infra build how many resource is created
terraform plan
```

### 3. Run Script

```
terraform apply
```

### (Optional) Destroy Infrasturcture

```bash
terraform destroy
```

### Debugging

Sometime `terraform` like a women hard to understand or hard to control like a man so we want to keep `terraform` logs in file.

Example

```bash
terraform plan 2>&1 | sed -r "s/\x1B\[([0-9]{1,2}(;[0-9]{1,2})?)?[m|K]//g" > output_plan.txt
```
